			<p><b>Grab Bag</b><br/>This will be a website for a Christmas grab bag. It will allow users to put in some personal information, such as an address and email, as well as what gifts they would like for the grab bag that year. Currently, this is a work in progress.<br/><br/><i>Django, Python</i></p>

			<p><b>Raindrops</b><br/>I used D3 in another project and thought it was lots of fun. These raindrops are a work in progress. Ultimately, it is supposed to have drops coming down the box and gathering in the bottom as if in a pool of water.<br/><br/><i>JavaScript, D3.js</i></p>

			<p><b>Solving the Eikonal Equation with the Fast Marching Method</b><br/>This was a class project that focused on advanced topics in scientific computing. This project implemented the Fast Marching Method (FMM) to solve the eikonal equation. The eikonal equation shows how fast information travels to an exit set. The FMM uses front propagation over a discretized domain to solve the eikonal equation.<br/><br/><i>Matlab</i></p>

			<p><b>Mine Sweeper</b><br/>Throwback code from an Advance Programming Topics course in 2010. This is code for the classic MineSweeper game that gives visual clues to the user whether or not they have found a bomb or a safe square. It generates a grid that places a speficied number of bombs over that grid. Users can change the grid size which will increase the number of bombs.<br/><br/><i>Java</i></p>

			<p><b>Pong</b><br/>Another piece of throwback code from the Advance Programming Topics course in 2010. This is the classic Pong game. Users start the game with a certain number of bricks in the middle of the winodws and can use the paddles on the sides of the screens to hit the balls and have them break down the brick wall in th middle.<br/><br/><i>Java</i></p>

		<div class="side-by-side-text">
			<p><b>Tic Tac Toe</b><br/>Last piece throwback code from the Advance Programming Topics course in 2010. This is Tac Tac Toe - human v. computer. Users start the game picking whether they think going first or second will give them more of an advantage, picking whether they want to be X's or O's, and finally pick the level they want to play at. The higher the level they pick, the more intelligent the computer AI becomes thus making it harder for the user to win the game.<br/><br/><i>Java</i></p>
