			<p>This is the classic <a href="https://github.com/colleencodes/MineSweeper" target="_blank">MineSweeper</a> game that gives visual clues to the user whether or not they have found a bomb or a safe square. It generates a grid that places a speficied number of bombs over that grid. Users can change the grid size which will increase the number of bombs. <br />Advanced Programming Topics: 2010</p>

			<h2>Javascript</h2>
			<p>I used D3 in another project and thought it was lots of fun. These <a href="https://github.com/colleencodes/RainDrops" target="_blank">raindrops</a> are a work in progress. Ultimately, it is supposed to have drops coming down the box and gathering in the bottom as if in a pool of water. Currently, this is a work in progress.</p>

			<h2>Matlab</h2>
			<p>This was a class project that focused solving the <a href="https://github.com/colleencodes/FastMarchingMethod" target="_blank">Eikonal Equation with the Fast Marching Method (FMM)</a>. The eikonal equation shows how fast information travels to an exit set. The FMM uses front propagation over a discretized domain to solve the eikonal equation.<br/>2015</p>
