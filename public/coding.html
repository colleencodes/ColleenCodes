			<p>I have been coding since 2006, when it all started with Visual Basic and simple code with a drag and drop UI. Since then, I have gained more skills.</p>
			
			<p>Progressing beyond VB allowed me to create some pretty cool programs during my undergraduate career.</p>
			<h2>Java</h2>
			<p><b>Mine Sweeper</b></p>
			<p>This is the classic MineSweeper game that gives visual clues to the user whether or not they have found a bomb or a safe square. It generates a grid that places a speficied number of bombs over that grid. Users can change the grid size which will increase the number of bombs. <br />Advanced Programming Topics: 2010</p>
			<p><b>Pong</b></p>
			<p>This is the classic Pong game. Users start the game with a certain number of bricks in the middle of the winodws and can use the paddles on the sides of the screens to hit the balls and have them break down the brick wall in th middle<br/>Advanced Programming Topics: 2010</p>
			<p><b>Tic Tac Toe</b></p>
			<p>This is Tac Tac Toe with human versus. computer. Users start the game picking whether they think going first or second will give them more of an advantage, picking whether they want to be X's or O's, and finally pick the level they want to play at.<br/>Advanced Programming Topics: 2010</p>

			<h2>Python</h2>
			<p>This will be a website for a Christmas grab bag. It will allow users to put in some personal information, such as an address and email, as well as what gifts they would like for the grab bag that year. Currently, this is a work in progress.</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Javascript</h2>
			<p>Using D3 in another project and thought it was lots of fun. These raindrops are a work in progress. Ultimately, it is supposed to have drops coming down the box and gathering in the bottom as if in a pool of water. Currently, this is a work in progress.</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Matlab</h2>
			<p>Solving the Eikonal Equation with the Fast Marching Method</b><br/>This was a class project that focused on advanced topics in scientific computing. This project implemented the Fast Marching Method (FMM) to solve the eikonal equation. The eikonal equation shows how fast information travels to an exit set. The FMM uses front propagation over a discretized domain to solve the eikonal equation.<br/>2015</p>
