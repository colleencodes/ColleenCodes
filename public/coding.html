			<p><b>Tic Tac Toe</b><br/>Last piece throwback code from the Advance Programming Topics course in 2010. This is Tac Tac Toe - human v. computer. Users start the game picking whether they think going first or second will give them more of an advantage, picking whether they want to be X's or O's, and finally pick the level they want to play at. The higher the level they pick, the more intelligent the computer AI becomes thus making it harder for the user to win the game.<br/><br/>Click here to see the source code.</p>
