			<p>I have a background in mathematics and computer science because I love to problem solve. I love knowing there is a final solution, but that how I get to there is up to me to solve as best and creatively as I can. The same philosophy holds true in knitting which is why it wasn't a huge stretch to have a deep interest in knitting. I have been knitting, occassionally crochetting, for more than 10 years.</p>
