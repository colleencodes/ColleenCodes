			<p>I have a background in mathematics and computer science because I love to problem solve. I love knowing there is a final solution, but that how I get to there is up to me to solve as best and creatively as I can. The same philosophy holds true in knitting which is why it wasn't a huge stretch to have a deep interest in knitting. I have been knitting, occassionally crochetting, for more than 10 years.<br/>Between 0's and 1's and knits and purls, I love to experiment and make beautiful code and knits.</p>

		<h1>1's and 0's, Knits and Purls</h1>
		<p>Coding is a simple concept - given certain inputs and a desired outcome, figure out the way to get there. It's beautiful in its simplicity to pull together an objective goal with a subjective way of achieving that goal.</p>
		<p>Knitting gives me a way to tangibly touch my code and my projects. Knititng has two basic stitches - knitting and purling, which every work is comprised of - not unlike 0's and 1's in programming! I have been knitting for more than 10 years - check out my knitting page to see some of my favorite projects.</p>
		<p>I have been programming also for about 10 years. I started out with Visual Basic in high school, moved onto Java in college, worked with MATLAB and a little C++ in grad school, and currently, work with Python/Django. Check out my coding page to see some highlighted projects as well as some projects I am currently working on.</p>
